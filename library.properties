sentence=This library generates and stores a backtrace of a crash in an IRAM or DRAM log buffer.
paragraph=An Arduino ESP8266 library that generates and stores a backtrace of a crash in an IRAM or DRAM log buffer. By crunching the stack trace and code to create a list of function addresses at play when the crash occurred, we can condense the amount of data that needs to be stored for later analysis. Reducing the data to a small list allows storage in slivers of unused IRAM or noinit DRAM, which can optionally be backed up to User RTC memory.
